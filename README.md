# Malaria_CNN
Malaria is a blood disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites. In many area,
malaria is still a serious problem. In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases
of malaria worldwide. The diagnosis method of malaria based on thin blood smear,
itâ€™s a big challenge for doctor. Using Machine Learning(ML) technology to analysis
thin blood smear image, based on Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), training
enough examples to build model. This model will be used to malaria diagnosis
without doctors.


# Environment setup
This project using tensorflow and Keras.
And the dataset from https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932, download the cell_images file and put in the Malaria_CNN


# Build
     cd Malaria_CNN
     python3 419project.py
